## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.
TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
